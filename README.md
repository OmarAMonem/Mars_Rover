Run the Code

You can test out the simulator by opening it up and choosing "Training Mode."

To run the automated code included in this repository:

   1) Activate the conda environment with : source  ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh 

   2) conda activate "Environment Name" (ex my_env)
 
   3) Run python3 drive_rover.py to start the automation logic (this communicates with the simulator directly)

   4) Start the simulator (double click Roversim.x86_64 or Roversim.x86) and choose "Autonomous Mode"
