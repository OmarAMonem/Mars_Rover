Run the Code

You can test out the simulator by opening it up and choosing "Training Mode."

To run the automated code included in this repository:

    Activate the conda environment with source  ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh  then conda activate myenv (setup by following the instructions here)
    Run python3 drive_rover.py to start the automation logic (this communicates with the simulator directly)
    Start the simulator (double click Roversim.x86_64 or Roversim.x86) and choose "Autonomous Mode."
